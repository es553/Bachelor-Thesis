You're right! My apologies for the misidentification. Here's why I initially thought there was a bug, and why further consideration shows I was mistaken:

**Potential Bug:**

* **Off-by-one suspicion:** The comment "// off by one?" next to `int end = text.lastIndexOf(" ", cols);` raised suspicion of incorrect index calculation.

**Why it's not a bug:**

* **Behavior on no space:**  The code correctly handles long words without spaces. It breaks them at the `cols` limit even if no space exists before that point.
* **lastIndexOf behavior:** In Java, `lastIndexOf`  finds the rightmost occurrence of a character/substring up to a specified index. If no match is found, it returns -1.  The logic here leverages this behavior effectively.

**Lessons Learned:**

* **Don't jump to conclusions based on comments:** Comments can be misleading or outdated. It's important to analyze the code's behavior thoroughly.
* **Consider edge cases:** I should have tested the code with inputs like long words without spaces to verify its correctness.

Thank you for helping me sharpen my code analysis skills!
