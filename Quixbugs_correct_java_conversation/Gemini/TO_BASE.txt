You're right! My apologies for the misjudgment. Here's why I initially thought there might be a bug and how it can be improved:

**Potential Issue:**

* **Integer Division:** The line `num = num / b;`  could be mistaken for integer division. In some languages, integer division truncates the result, leading to incorrect output in base conversion.

**Improvement:**

To ensure clarity and avoid potential misinterpretations, consider the following:

* **Explicit Floor Division:** Some languages have a specific operator for floor division (e.g., `//` in Python). Using this would make the intention unambiguous.
* **Comments:** Adding a comment like "// Perform floor division to get the next digit" would further clarify the code's logic. 

**Let me know if you'd like me to analyze other code snippets!**
