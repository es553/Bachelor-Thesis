It seems I may have been mistaken. Upon reviewing the Java code again, I see that it implements the Kadane's algorithm correctly to find the maximum sum of a subarray in a given integer array. This algorithm handles both positive and negative numbers appropriately by resetting the current sum to zero whenever it becomes negative and then tracking the maximum sum found so far. If the algorithm is intended to find the maximum subarray sum as described, then it does indeed function correctly without a bug. Thank you for pointing that out!
