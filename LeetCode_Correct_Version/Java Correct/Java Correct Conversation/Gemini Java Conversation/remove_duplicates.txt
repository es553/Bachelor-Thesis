You're right! My apologies for the misidentification. Here's why this code actually does work to remove duplicates from a sorted array:

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  
   - `j` starts at 1, indicating the index where the next unique element will be placed.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates from the second element (`i = 1`) to the end of the array.
   - **Comparison:** If the current element (`nums[i]`) is different from the previous element (`nums[i - 1]`), we've found a unique element.

3. **Unique Element Handling:**
    - The unique element (`nums[i]`) is copied to the position pointed to by `j`.
    - `j` is incremented to point to the next position for the next potential unique element.

4. **Result:** 
   - The final value of `j` represents the length of the new array with duplicates removed. 

**Let me know if you'd like a more elaborate explanation or want to test other code snippets!**
