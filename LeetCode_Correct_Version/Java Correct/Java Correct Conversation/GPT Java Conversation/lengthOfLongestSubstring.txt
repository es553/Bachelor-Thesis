Upon reviewing the program again, I can confirm that there is indeed a bug in the method for calculating the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

The issue lies in the approach to handling characters already present in the deque. The program attempts to remove characters from the front of the deque until the repeated character is removed, allowing the substring to be considered unique again. However, the current code only removes one character from the front whenever a duplicate character is encountered, regardless of where the duplicate character is located in the deque. This means it may not remove the right characters to make the substring unique again.

Here's a detailed look at the problem:

If s.charAt(left) exists in the deque, the program removes the first element in the deque, not necessarily the duplicate element. Thus, it can incorrectly remove the wrong characters, failing to properly adjust the current window of unique characters.

This results in incorrect substring boundaries and subsequently an incorrect maximum length calculation. Therefore, the original conclusion of a bug in the code stands.
