Let's revisit the code for errors or logical issues:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        if len(s) < 2:
            return len(s)
        max_length = 0
        first, second = 0, 1
        sub = set()
        sub.add(s[0])
        while first < len(s) and second < len(s):
            ch = s[second]
            if ch in sub:
                while ch in sub:
                    sub.remove(s[first])
                    first += 1
                continue
            second += 1
            sub.add(ch)
            max_length = max(max_length, len(sub))
        return max_length


Upon reviewing the code again, I notice an issue with how the max_length is updated. The max_length variable is updated within the if ch not in sub branch after adding a new character to the sub set. However, the update should also be outside the while-loop to handle the scenario where the last characters of the string form the longest substring without any duplicates.

Here's the corrected observation:

The max_length update should happen after every successful addition of a new character to sub and not be confined inside the condition if ch not in sub.
The continue statement after removing a character from sub when a duplicate is found is mispositioned. It should not skip the subsequent operations like incrementing second and updating max_length outside the if-block for checking duplicates.

To correctly handle the length calculation, the code should ensure max_length is compared after the inner loop completes. Also, the increment of second should occur in every iteration of the main loop, not just when the character is not a duplicate.

Here's how the logic should be corrected:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        if len(s) < 2:
            return len(s)
        max_length = 0
        first, second = 0, 1
        sub = set()
        sub.add(s[0])
        while second < len(s):
            ch = s[second]
            if ch in sub:
                sub.remove(s[first])
                first += 1
            else:
                sub.add(ch)
                second += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, len(sub))
        return max_length


This code ensures that the max_length is updated appropriately whether a character is removed or added, and it correctly progresses second through the string.
