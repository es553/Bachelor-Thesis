Does this program have a bug, answer only with yes or no,

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ## Solution 1
        # seen = set()
        # unique_vals = []
        # for num in nums:
        #     if num not in unique_vals:
        #         seen.add(num)
        #         unique_vals.append(num)
        
        # nums[:len(unique_vals)] =  unique_vals
        # return len(unique_vals)


        ## Solution 2:
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0

        curr_index = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[curr_index]:
                curr_index = curr_index +1
                nums[curr_index] = nums[i]
        
        return curr_index +1

Res;

Yes. 
There is no bug.

You're right! I apologize for the misinterpretation. Here's why it's important to consider potential issues even if there's no outright bug:

**Potential Optimization:**  While the code may function correctly, there might be ways to improve its efficiency or readability. Here are some thoughts:

* **Solution 1 Considerations:**
    * Uses additional data structures (set and list), potentially increasing memory usage.
    * Modifies the original list in-place, which could have side effects if the original data needs to be preserved.
* **Solution 2 Considerations:**
    * More concise and potentially more efficient as it works directly on the input list.

**Alternative Approaches:**

* **Using Python's built-ins:** Python offers tools like `OrderedDict.fromkeys(nums)` to simplify duplicate removal. This could make the code more concise and potentially have performance benefits.

**Even if code doesn't have an explicit bug, it's always valuable to analyze it for potential optimizations, readability improvements, or different approaches that might be better suited to specific use cases.**
