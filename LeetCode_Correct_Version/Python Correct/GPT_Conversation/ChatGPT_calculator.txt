Does this program have a bug, answer only with yes or no.
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        ans = 0
        num = 0
        sign = 1
        stack = [1]  # Initialize stack with 1 for the base multiplier

        for c in s:
            if c.isdigit():
                num = num * 10 + int(c)
            elif c == '+':
                ans += sign * num
                num = 0
                sign = stack[-1]  # Use the top of the stack as the sign for the current context
            elif c == '-':
                ans += sign * num
                num = 0
                sign = -stack[-1]  # Flip the sign based on the top of the stack
            elif c == '(':
                stack.append(sign)  # Push the current sign to the stack
            elif c == ')':
                ans += sign * num
                num = 0
                sign = stack.pop()  # Pop the top of the stack to restore the previous sign context
            # Else: ignore any spaces or other characters

        ans += sign * num  # Add the last number processed
        return ans

Apologies for any confusion. On reevaluating, the program does not appear to have a bug for handling basic mathematical expressions with addition, subtraction, and parentheses, assuming it is designed to handle simple arithmetic expressions and ignores all characters other than digits, '+', '-', '(', and ')'. If you have a specific input or scenario in mind that you think might not be handled correctly, feel free to share it!
