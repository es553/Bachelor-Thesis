Let's take another look at the code. The function to_base aims to convert a number to a different base. However, there might be an edge case that the function does not handle properly: when num is 0. The while loop while num > 0: does not execute if num is 0, which means the function would return an empty string instead of "0". For many base conversion scenarios, you would expect 0 to be represented as "0" in any base.

Thus, if the input num is 0, the function should still return "0", which it currently does not, hence why I considered it as having a bug. If this edge case isn't a concern for your specific usage, then the function would work correctly for positive integers.
