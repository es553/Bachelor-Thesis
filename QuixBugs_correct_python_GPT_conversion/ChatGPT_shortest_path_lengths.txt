The code you've shared is intended to compute shortest paths in a graph using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Initially, it looks correct in setting up the distances and implementing the algorithm's logic.

If you believe there's no bug, it's possible that the code functions correctly for your specific use cases or inputs. However, in general programming practice, there might be a potential oversight regarding how Python dictionaries are updated which could lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully, especially if length_by_edge keys overlap with (i, i) keys initialized to 0. This would not typically cause a logical error in the context of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm but is something to be aware of in other applications.

If you have specific scenarios or conditions under which this code was tested, it would help in further verifying the correctness of the function.
