Let's re-examine the function rpn_eval. The potential bug arises when the op function is applied. In Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), the last number pushed onto the stack should be used as the right-hand operand and the second last as the left-hand operand for the operation. However, in your function, the order in which operands a and b are popped and then passed to the op function is reversed:

python
Copy code
a = stack.pop()
b = stack.pop()
stack.append(op(token, b, a))


This effectively means that b is treated as the left-hand operand and a as the right-hand, which reverses their intended roles. For example, in an expression that should evaluate 3 - 2 to 1, your function will evaluate it as 2 - 3 resulting in -1. This error affects subtraction and division operations due to their non-commutativity.

This suggests there is indeed a bug related to operand ordering for certain operations in the rpn_eval function.
