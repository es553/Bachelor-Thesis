There seems to have been a misunderstanding. Let's clarify the function's behavior.

The function get_factors is intended to return the prime factors of a given integer n. It checks for divisibility starting from 2 up to the square root of n. If a divisor is found, it returns a list containing this divisor followed by the recursive call to find the factors of the quotient n // i.

However, the function may fail to return all the prime factors in cases where the number has multiple identical prime factors. For example, for n = 8, the function would return [2] when the correct factorization is [2, 2, 2]. This is because the function returns after finding the first divisor and does not continue to check if the number can be divided by the same factor again.

This is the bug: the function does not handle multiple occurrences of the same prime factor correctly. It should continue to check for further divisibility by the found factor before moving to the next.
