Without additional context on the behavior of the data structures or the requirements, it's challenging to definitively say if there's no bug. However, reviewing the function again, it appears to implement a simplified version of Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting. There is a potential issue with the function as it mutates the ordered_nodes list while iterating over it, which can lead to unexpected behavior or miss some nodes depending on the structure of the graph. If your graph behaves as expected with this function, it might work for your specific setup, but this approach can be problematic in general for topological sorting.
