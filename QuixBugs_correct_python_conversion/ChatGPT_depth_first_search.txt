To fix the bug in your depth-first search implementation, you need to add the node to the nodesvisited set before making recursive calls. This ensures that each node is marked as visited prior to visiting its successors, preventing infinite loops in graphs with cycles. Hereâ€™s the corrected version of your function:

python
Copy code
def depth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):
    nodesvisited = set()

    def search_from(node):
        if node in nodesvisited:
            return False
        nodesvisited.add(node)  # Move this line up here
        if node is goalnode:
            return True
        else:
            return any(
                search_from(nextnode) for nextnode in node.successors
            )

    return search_from(startnode)


With this change, nodesvisited.add(node) is executed before exploring successors, ensuring that each node is checked exactly once.
