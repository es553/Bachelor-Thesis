Here's the fixed version of the detect_cycle function, which correctly checks for cycles in a linked list using the "hare and tortoise" algorithm. The key change I made was in the condition that checks if the hare or any of its successors is None before proceeding to move the hare twice ahead. This prevents accessing a None type attribute and causing an error.

python
Copy code
def detect_cycle(node):
    if not node:
        return False

    hare = tortoise = node

    while True:
        if hare is None or hare.successor is None:
            return False

        tortoise = tortoise.successor
        hare = hare.successor.successor

        if hare is tortoise:
            return True


This version of the function first checks if the initial node is None and returns False if that's the case, indicating no cycle. The main loop then safely advances the hare and tortoise pointers, properly handling the situation where the hare or its successor might be None.
