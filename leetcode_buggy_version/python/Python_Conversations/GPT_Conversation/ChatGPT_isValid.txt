The bug in the original code is in the last line where it checks return len(stack) == 1. This should instead verify whether the stack is empty to confirm that all brackets have been correctly matched and closed. The correct condition should be return len(stack) == 0. Here's the corrected version of the code:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        if s[0] in (')', '}', ']'):
            return False

        stack = []

        par = {
            ')': '(',
            '}': '{',
            ']': '['
        }

        for paran in s:
            if paran in ('(', '[', '{'):  # 1
                stack.append(paran)

            elif stack and par[paran] == stack[-1]:  # 2
                stack.pop()

            else:
                return False  # 3

        return len(stack) == 0  # Fixed here to check if stack is empty

    # 1. If we encounter an open bracket, then append it.
    # 2. Else if it is a closed one, use it as an entry in the dict to retrieve the corresponding bracket and compare it with the last element in the stack.
    # 3. Finally, if the stack is empty and the next char not in ('(', '[', '{')), return false.


This updated code correctly ensures that all types of brackets are properly opened and closed in the given string.
