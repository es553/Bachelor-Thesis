Does this program have a bug, answer only with yes or no. 


class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ## Solution 1
        # seen = set()
        # unique_vals = []
        # for num in nums:
        #     if num not in unique_vals:
        #         seen.add(num)
        #         unique_vals.append(num)
        
        # nums[:len(unique_vals)] =  unique_vals
        # return len(unique_vals)


        ## Solution 2:
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0

        curr_index = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[curr_index]:
                curr_index = curr_index +1
                nums[curr_index] = nums[i]
        
        return curr_index +1

Res :
- Yes 

Fix the bug and provide the complete fixed code.

Absolutely! Here's a breakdown of the bug and the fixed code.

**The Bug**

The provided code has a subtle bug in Solution 1. Here's the issue:

* **Incorrect Modification:** The line `nums[:len(unique_vals)] = unique_vals` attempts to modify the original `nums` list in-place. However, this technique might not correctly update the beginning of the list, leading to unexpected residues of old values.

**Fixed Code (With Explanations)**

Here's a corrected version focusing on Solution 2, as it's generally more efficient:

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0

        curr_index = 0  # Index of the next unique element
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):  # Start from the second element
            if nums[i] != nums[curr_index]:
                curr_index += 1
                nums[curr_index] = nums[i]

        return curr_index + 1  # The length of the unique portion
```

**Explanation of the Fix**

1. **Two-Pointer Approach:** The code uses two pointers: `curr_index` keeps track of the end of the unique portion of the array, and `i` iterates through the array.
2. **Comparison:** If the current element (`nums[i]`) is different from the element at `curr_index`, we've found a new unique element.
3. **Update:**  We increment `curr_index` and copy `nums[i]` to `nums[curr_index]`, effectively moving the unique element to its correct position.
4. **Final Length:**  After the loop, `curr_index + 1` represents the length of the array with duplicates removed.
