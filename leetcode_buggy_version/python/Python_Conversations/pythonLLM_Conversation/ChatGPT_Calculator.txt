Here's the fixed version of your provided Python program. The primary issue in the original code was related to how the sign was being updated and how it interacted with the contents of the stack. The sign should flip based on the current operator encountered and the top value of the stack. Also, the initialization of the stack was incorrect.

    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        ans = 0
        num = 0
        sign = 1
        stack = [1]  # Initialize stack with 1 for the base multiplier

        for c in s:
            if c.isdigit():
                num = num * 10 + int(c)
            elif c == '+':
                ans += sign * num
                num = 0
                sign = stack[-1]  # Use the top of the stack as the sign for the current context
            elif c == '-':
                ans += sign * num
                num = 0
                sign = -stack[-1]  # Flip the sign based on the top of the stack
            elif c == '(':
                stack.append(sign)  # Push the current sign to the stack
            elif c == ')':
                ans += sign * num
                num = 0
                sign = stack.pop()  # Pop the top of the stack to restore the previous sign context
            # Else: ignore any spaces or other characters

        ans += sign * num  # Add the last number processed
        return ans


This corrected version ensures that signs are correctly managed through parenthesis scopes using a stack, and the operations are appropriately calculated whether inside or outside of parentheses.
