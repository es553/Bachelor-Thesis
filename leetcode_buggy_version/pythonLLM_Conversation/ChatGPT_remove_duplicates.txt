Here's the corrected version of your program. The main issue was with the for loop condition and how curr_index was updated in the "Solution 2" block. The loop was incorrectly iterating over every index, and the comparison of nums[i] was against the incorrect curr_index, which could lead to out-of-bounds errors. I fixed it by ensuring the loop checks only necessary elements and updates correctly:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        
        curr_index = 0  # Start from the first element
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):  # Start from the second element
            if nums[i] != nums[curr_index]:  # Check if the current number is different from the last unique number
                curr_index += 1  # Move the index of the last unique number
                nums[curr_index] = nums[i]  # Update the position with the new unique number
        
        return curr_index + 1  # Return the count of unique numbers


This solution maintains a pointer curr_index for the position of the last unique number in the list. As it encounters a new unique number, it increments the curr_index and places the new number at that position. This effectively compacts the array with unique elements up front and returns the number of such unique elements.
