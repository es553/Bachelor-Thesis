Here's the corrected code for the linear search algorithm, where I've adjusted the return statement in the loop to avoid using the index() method, which could lead to incorrect results if the list contains duplicate values. Instead, I've directly used the loop index:

python
Copy code
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        for i, x in enumerate(nums):
            if x == target:
                return i
        return -1


This fix ensures that the function returns the first index where the target is found and returns -1 if the target is not present in the list, which aligns with common conventions in search algorithms.
