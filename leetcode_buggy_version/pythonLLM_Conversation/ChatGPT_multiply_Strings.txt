The original code snippet you provided is mostly correct and should function as intended if the inputs are strings representing non-negative integers. However, if you're experiencing issues, it might be related to specific edge cases such as empty strings or non-integer inputs, which aren't handled by the code.

Below, I've adjusted the code to explicitly handle cases where num1 or num2 might be empty strings, as attempting to multiply when either is empty should logically result in "0". This ensures that the function returns a sensible result even if provided with an empty input. No changes are needed for the main logic if we assume valid, non-empty numeric strings are given.

class Solution:
    def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        if not num1 or not num2:
            return "0"
        
        a = 0
        for i in range(len(num1)):
            a = a * 10 + int(num1[i])
        
        b = 0
        for i in range(len(num2)):
            b = b * 10 + int(num2[i])

        return str(a * b)


This fixed version includes a check at the beginning of the multiply method to return "0" if either num1 or num2 is an empty string, as multiplying by zero results in zero. This is a practical approach in real-world scenarios where inputs might not always be controlled.
