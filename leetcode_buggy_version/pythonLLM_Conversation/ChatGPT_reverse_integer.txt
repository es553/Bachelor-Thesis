Certainly! The issue in your code is related to how the reversal and re-signing of the number is handled. The reversed_x += sign logic is incorrect because it modifies the reversed number incorrectly when attempting to reapply the original number's sign. Instead, the sign should be multiplied with the reversed number.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        INT_MAX = 2**31 - 1
        INT_MIN = -2**31
        sign = -1 if x < 0 else 1

        # Checking this at the start isn't needed as 'x' is initially within int limits
        str_x = str(abs(x))
        reversed_str_x = str_x[::-1]
        reversed_x = int(reversed_str_x)

        reversed_x *= sign  # Correctly apply the sign by multiplication

        # Check if the reversed number is outside the 32-bit integer range
        if reversed_x > INT_MAX or reversed_x < INT_MIN:
            return 0
        
        return reversed_x


This version correctly reverses the digits, reapplies the sign through multiplication, and checks if the reversed integer overflows or underflows the 32-bit signed integer range.
