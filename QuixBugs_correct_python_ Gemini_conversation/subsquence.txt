It's difficult to say definitively without more context. Here's why:

**Potential Issue:** The logic seems intended to generate subsequences of length `k`. However, there might be off-by-one errors or edge case handling issues depending on how you define "subsequence." 

**Need for Context:**

* **What's the precise definition of a "subsequence" in your problem?** Does order matter? Can elements be repeated? 
* **What are the intended inputs and expected outputs?** Providing some test cases would be ideal. 

**How to Test:**

1. **Define your subsequence criteria.**
2. **Create test cases with varying inputs (a, b, k).** Include edge cases like empty lists and k values larger than the input list size.
3. **Run the function and compare the output to your hand-calculated expectations.**

Let me know if you can provide those details, and I'll gladly help you determine if there's a bug.
