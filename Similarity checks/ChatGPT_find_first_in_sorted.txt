Here's the corrected version of your function. The bug was primarily due to the incorrect updating of the hi index within the loop. Specifically, setting hi = mid in the binary search can cause an infinite loop because the value of hi may not decrease if mid equals hi. The correct approach is to decrease hi by one more than mid (i.e., hi = mid - 1) to ensure the range decreases with each iteration. Also, the condition in the while loop should be lo < hi instead of lo <= hi to avoid accessing an index out of bounds.

Here's the fixed code:

python
Copy code
def find_first_in_sorted(arr, x):
    lo = 0
    hi = len(arr) - 1

    while lo <= hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2

        if x == arr[mid] and (mid == 0 or x != arr[mid - 1]):
            return mid

        elif x <= arr[mid]:
            hi = mid - 1

        else:
            lo = mid + 1

    return -1


This modification ensures the function avoids the infinite loop and correctly finds the first occurrence of x in a sorted array, if it exists.
