Res 
* Yes 
* Fix the bug and provide the complete fixed code.
Absolutely! Here's the fixed code along with an explanation of the bug:
Original Bug:
The original code had a subtle error in the hi = mid assignment within the elif block. If x is equal to arr[mid], the search should continue in the lower half of the array, but hi = mid doesn't exclude the current middle element.
Fixed Code:
Python
def find_first_in_sorted(arr, x):
    lo = 0
    hi = len(arr) - 1  # Change here


    while lo <= hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2


        if x == arr[mid] and (mid == 0 or x != arr[mid - 1]):
            return mid


        elif x <= arr[mid]:
            hi = mid - 1  # Change here


        else:
            lo = mid + 1


    return -1


Explanation of Changes:
1. Initialization of hi: We initialize hi = len(arr) - 1 to ensure that we start searching from the last index of the array.
2. hi Update: Inside the elif block, we update hi = mid - 1 to correctly narrow the search range to the lower half of the array, excluding the current middle element.
How the Fixed Code Works
This corrected implementation performs a binary search to find the first occurrence of x in the sorted array arr. If x is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence; otherwise, it returns -1.
