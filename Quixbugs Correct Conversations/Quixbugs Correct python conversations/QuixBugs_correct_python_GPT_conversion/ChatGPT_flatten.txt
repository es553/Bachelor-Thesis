The bug in your original code occurs because the flatten function is attempting to recursively yield items from nested lists, but it doesn't handle the recursive yield properly in the context of Python generators. To fix this, we can use yield from instead of the inner loop for y in flatten(x). Hereâ€™s the corrected code:

python
Copy code
def flatten(arr):
    for x in arr:
        if isinstance(x, list):
            yield from flatten(x)
        else:
            yield x


This correction ensures that all items from a nested list are correctly yielded by the generator.
