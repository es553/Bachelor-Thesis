Upon further examination, it appears there is indeed a bug in the function. The problem arises from the recursive call possible_change(coins, total - first), where the function calls itself using the same list of coins, potentially leading to infinite recursion if the first coin value does not reduce the total to zero or a negative value. Thus, the function can go into an infinite loop if a solution is not found, causing a stack overflow.
