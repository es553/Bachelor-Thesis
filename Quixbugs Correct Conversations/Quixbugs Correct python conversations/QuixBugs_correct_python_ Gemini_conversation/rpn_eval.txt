Res
Yes.

there is no bug 

You're right! I apologize for the misjudgment. Here's why the code might initially seem buggy and steps you can take to confirm its correctness:

**Potential Bug Misinterpretation**

* **Reversed Operands:**  The `op` function takes operands in the order (b, a), which reverses the typical order for arithmetic operations. This could lead to unexpected results if not carefully considered.

**How to Verify Correctness**

1. **Unit Tests:** Write thorough unit tests with various input combinations and expected outputs. Cover both valid and edge cases (like division by zero).
2. **Example Walkthroughs:** Manually simulate the evaluation of sample RPN expressions using this code. Compare the results to your expectations.
3. **Code Review:** Carefully review the logic within the `op` function and the overall stack manipulation to ensure they align with RPN principles.

**Let me know if you'd like help constructing test cases or walking through examples to gain more confidence in the code!**
