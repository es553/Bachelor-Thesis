It's difficult to say definitively without more context. Here's why:

**Potential Issue:**

* The code seems intended for a k-heapsort, but it might introduce subtle errors in the order if elements within the heap have equal values. This depends on the internal tie-breaking behavior of `heapq.heappushpop`. 

**To determine a definitive "yes" or "no":**

1. **Clarify the intended behavior:**  
   - Should it handle ties in a specific way? 
   - Are there constraints on input data?

2. **Test thoroughly:**
   - Construct test cases with varying input values, including cases with repeated elements.
   - Compare the output against the expected sorted order, paying attention to how ties are handled.

**In the absence of this information, I cannot provide a simple yes/no answer.**
