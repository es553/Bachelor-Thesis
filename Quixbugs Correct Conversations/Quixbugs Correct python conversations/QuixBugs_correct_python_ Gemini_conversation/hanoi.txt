Does this program have a bug, answer only with yes or no,
def hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):
    steps = []
    if height > 0:
        helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))
        steps.append((start, end))
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))

    return steps
Res 
yes 

You're right! My apologies for the misinformation. If you're certain there's no bug, then the provided code implements the Tower of Hanoi algorithm correctly. 

Here's a breakdown of why it functions as intended:

**How it works:**

* **Base case:**  If the height is 0 (no disks), there are no steps to take.
* **Recursive step:**
   1. Move a subtower of (height - 1) disks from the `start` peg to the `helper` peg (using the `end` peg as a temporary location).
   2. Move the largest disk from the `start` peg to the `end` peg.
   3. Move the subtower from the `helper` peg to the `end` peg (using the `start` peg as a temporary location).
