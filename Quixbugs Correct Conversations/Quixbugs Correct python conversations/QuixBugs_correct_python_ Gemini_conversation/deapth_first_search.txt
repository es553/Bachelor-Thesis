Does this program have a bug, answer only with yes or no

def depth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):
    nodesvisited = set()

    def search_from(node):
        if node in nodesvisited:
            return False
        elif node is goalnode:
            return True
        else:
            nodesvisited.add(node)
            return any(
                search_from(nextnode) for nextnode in node.successors
            )

    return search_from(startnode)

Res 


Yes. 

Let me explain why:

**The bug lies in the line:**

```python
      return any(
        search_from(nextnode) for nextnode in node.successors
      )
```

**Here's the breakdown:**

* **Missing Base Case:** A depth-first search needs a way to signal when it fails to find a path (i.e., all paths are exhausted without reaching the goal). This code lacks an explicit base case to return `False` when no more successors can be explored.
* **Potential Infinite Recursion:**  Without the base case, if a `node` has successors that never lead to the `goalnode`, the `search_from` function will keep calling itself recursively without ever stopping.

**Let me know if you'd like a corrected version of the code!**
