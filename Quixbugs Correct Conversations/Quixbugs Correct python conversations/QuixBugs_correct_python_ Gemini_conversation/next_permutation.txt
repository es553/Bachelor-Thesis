Yes 

there is no bug
You're right! My apologies for the misidentification. It seems the `next_permutation` function is designed to correctly compute the next lexicographic permutation. Here's why I initially thought there was a bug:

**Potential Misconceptions**

* **Modifying Input:** It's uncommon for in-place algorithms to return the modified input. This initially made me think there might be an unintended side effect. 
* **Variable Usage:** The variable `next_perm` seems to be used for intermediate calculation but not strictly necessary for the final output.

**Why It Works:**

Upon closer inspection, here's the breakdown of how the algorithm correctly finds the next permutation:

1. **Find Inversion Point:** It scans from the right, finding the first index `i` where `perm[i] < perm[i + 1]`. This is the point where the permutation can be increased.
2. **Find Swap Target:** It finds the smallest element in the suffix after `i` that's still larger than `perm[i]`. This element is the target for the swap.
3. **Swap:** Swap `perm[i]` and the target element.
4. **Reverse Suffix:** Reverse the suffix after position `i` to get the smallest lexicographically larger permutation.

**Let me know if you'd like to test this function with an example input!**
