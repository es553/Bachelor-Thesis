The bug in your code is related to how Python dictionaries handle concurrency. In the original code, updating the dictionary memo within the loop risks updating the entries for the current capacity before they are used to compute the values for larger capacities. To fix this, you should iterate over the capacities in reverse order when updating the memo dictionary. This ensures that when updating memo[i, j], the necessary values from memo[i - 1, j] and memo[i - 1, j - weight] have not yet been modified. Here's the fixed code:

python
Copy code
def knapsack(capacity, items):
    from collections import defaultdict
    memo = defaultdict(int)

    for i in range(1, len(items) + 1):
        weight, value = items[i - 1]
        
        for j in range(capacity, 0, -1):
            memo[i, j] = memo[i - 1, j]
            if weight <= j:
                memo[i, j] = max(memo[i, j], value + memo[i - 1, j - weight])

    return memo[len(items), capacity]


In this corrected version, the for j in range(capacity, 0, -1): loop ensures that each j value is processed from the maximum down to 1, which preserves the integrity of the data used from the previous iterations.
