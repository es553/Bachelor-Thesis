Here's the corrected version of your bucketsort function. The main issue was with the second loop where the variable count was incorrectly iterated over arr instead of counts. Here's the correct implementation:

python
Copy code
def bucketsort(arr, k):
    # Initialize count array with zeros
    counts = [0] * k
    # Count the occurrence of each number in the input array
    for x in arr:
        counts[x] += 1

    # Construct the sorted array
    sorted_arr = []
    for i, count in enumerate(counts):
        sorted_arr.extend([i] * count)

    return sorted_arr


This corrected code correctly sorts the input array arr using bucket sort, given that all elements of arr are non-negative integers less than k.
